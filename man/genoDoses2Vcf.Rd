\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix of bi-allelic SNP genotypes encoded, for each SNP, in number of copies of its second allele, i.e. as allele doses in \{0,1,2\}, with genotypes in rows and SNPs in columns; the "second" allele corresponds to the second column of \code{alleles} and will be interpreted as 'alt'}

\item{snp.coords}{data.frame with SNP identifiers as row names, and two columns, "chr" and "pos" (or "coord"); columns as factors will be converted into characters}

\item{alleles}{data.frame (or matrix) with SNPs in rows (names as row names) and alleles in columns (exactly 2 columns are required); the first column will be interpreted as 'ref' and the second column, which should correspond to the allele which number of copies is counted at each SNP in \code{X}, will be interpreted as 'alt'; columns as factors will be converted into characters}

\item{file.date}{date to indicate into the object}

\item{si}{output from the "seqinfo" function from the GenomeInfoDb package}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level (0/1)}
